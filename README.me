In this project we're gonna find out how many squirrel per color existed in Central Park at the year 2018! The data we're using is from the website data.cityofnewyork.us and it's related to "The Squirrel Census" a project focusing on Squirrels.

The csv file contains squirrel data for each of the 3,023 sightings, including location cordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities, communications, and interactions between squirrels and humans.

I've done it in two ways, the first one was a more code was my first approach to the problem and the second one was after searching better how i could find it more easily/faster

This little data analysis is the activity for the Day 25 of the 100 Days of Python course!
